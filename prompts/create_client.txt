We want to implement an S3 client to submit the training dataset creation job as a JSON to S3. Implement an adapter `training_dataset_job_client.go` that writes the following JSON to a S3 bucket (the values are examples):

```
{
    "corpus_s3_path": "/documents/eurlex",
    "corpus_files_subset": [],
    "language_iso": "deu",
    "user_id": "72b45c20-874e-4e2a-871c-519de0b0d5eb",
    "training_dataset_id": "9c29d344-bade-4e98-ae0b-910841068790",
    "generate_prompt": "You task is to generate training dataset for question answering.",
    "generate_examples_number": 100
    "generate_model": "gemma3:8b",
    "generate_model_runner": "runpod_ollama"
}
```

We will configure the S3 client with three environment variables, you can assume they exist: AWS_ENDPOINT_URL, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION and APP_S3_BUCKET. The path for the job files is `/jobs`.

The job file will be written in the use case after we created the training dataset in the database.
