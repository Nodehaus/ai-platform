In the `/api/projects` GET endpoint that lists the projects, add the `training_dataset_id` field with the ID of the training dataset with the latest version. Do not add the training dataset ID to the NewCreateProjectResponse. Also do not add the training dataset IDs to the project entity in the ListProjectUseCase. Instead add a ListProjects function to the project service that the use case will call.
