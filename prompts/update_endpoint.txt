In the `/api/projects` GET endpoint that lists the projects, add the `training_dataset_id` field with the ID of the training dataset with the latest version. Do not add the training dataset ID to the NewCreateProjectResponse. Also do not add the training dataset IDs to the project entity in the ListProjectUseCase. Instead add a ListProjects function to the project service that the use case will call.

In the `/api/projects/{project_id}/training-datasets` POST endpoint add a field `generate_examples_number` with the number of training examples that we want to generate for the training dataset. Add this number to the final database entry.

---

In the `internal/adapter/in/web/get_deployment_controller.go` add a sample of the deployment logs to the response. We want to receive the 10 latest log entries of that deployment ID, only date, input and output. You can find a similar response in `internal/adapter/in/web/get_training_dataset_controller.go` that returns 10 examples of the training dataset.
