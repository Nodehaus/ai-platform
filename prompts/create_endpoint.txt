The training dataset and finetune are empty. The status is `ACTIVE`.

Add an endpoint to create a new initial training dateset for a project. You can find information about the database models in `plans/database_models.md`.

{
    "corpus_name": "eurlex",

    "output_field": "answer",
    "language_iso": "deu",
    "field_names": ["question", "answer", "complexity"],
    "generate_prompt": "You task is to generate training dataset for question answering."
}

The status is `PLANNING`. The prompt history is empty.
