We want to activate the `+ Create New Project` button in `cmd/web/homepage.templ`. A click on the button will display a pop that asks for a project name. When the user entered the name and confirms then we will send a create project POST request to the API `/api/projects`. The user will be forwarded to a new page `/web/projects/{project_id}/training-datasets/step1` that will start a wizard to collect the parameters for the training dataset. We will implement the wizard later, for now just add `step1` page with the info that the project was created.
