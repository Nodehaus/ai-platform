In `internal/application/domain/use_cases/create_project_use_case_impl.go` you added a function `NewCreateProjectUseCase` to create an instance of the use case implementation. Should that be a part of the global dependency injection in `internal/common/di_module.go`? You also use this pattern in other files, please check the approach and give advice if and how we can refactor that. Do not modify any code yet.
